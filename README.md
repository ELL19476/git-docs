# GIT Docs
Welcome to git docs! Colaborate with me to create a nice overview of important git commands - while using git!

# How To
- ```git init```
- ```git remote add origin https://github.com/ELL19476/git-docs.git```
- ```git fetch```
- ```git checkout main```
- Open the Docs.md file
- Every command should be labeled with a a heading 2: ```## git init``` and then a plaintext description
- Use a heading 3 ```### Important Flags``` and a list (```- bullet point 1```) to list important flags (= options) this command might have
- Add & commit your changes and write a precise commit message
- Request access from me (write me your username in the google meet chat)
- Push into the ```main``` branch, you might need to use ```git push --set-upstream origin main```
- Maybe someone pushed while you where editing, in that case, use ```git pull``` first
