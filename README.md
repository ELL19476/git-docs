# GIT Docs
Welcome to git docs! Colaborate with me to create a nice overview of important git commands - while using git!

# How To
- ```git init```
- ```git remote add origin https://github.com/ELL19476/git-docs.git```
- ```git fetch```
- ```git checkout main```
- Open the Docs.md file
- Every command should be a heading 2: ```## Git Init``` and then a plaintext description
- Commit your changes
- Request access from me (write me your username in the google meet chat)
- Push into the ```main``` branch, you might need to use ```git push --set-upstream origin main```
- Maybe someone pushed while you where editing, in that case, use ```git pull``` first
